*** Installation:

Step 0: it is assumed that the "retalis" package has been downloaded to the "catkin_ws/src" folder

Step 1: install OpenGL Mathematics (GLM)  
	1- sudo apt-get install libglm-dev

Step 2: install SWI-PL as a shared library
	1- Download pl source code (6.2.2. for me) from http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable
	2- Extract the tarball and edit the build.templ file as follows: 
		Set PREFIX=/usr
		Set SUDO="sudo"
		Disable some library that might cause problem by uncommenting 
			export DISABLE_PKGS="ssl  xpce zlib"
		Uncomment the following
			EXTRACFG+=" --enable-shared"

	3- Run build.templ. (as root)
	4- Make sure libswipl.so has been created. In my system, it is found at
		/usr/lib/swipl-6.2.2/lib/i686-linux/libswipl.so


Step 3: install Retalis as follows
	1- In the CMakeLists.txt file, change "/usr/lib/swipl-6.6.6/include" and "/usr/lib/swipl-6.6.6/lib/x86_64-linux" according to your SWI-PL installtion
	2- catkin_make
	3- In the install.py file, change '/home/robolab/catkin_ws' and '/usr/lib/swipl-6.6.6/lib/x86_64-linux' according to your your catkin_ws path and SWI-PL installation, respectively
	4- Execute install.py as root (you might first need to make the install.py file executable by: sudo chmod +x install.py)
